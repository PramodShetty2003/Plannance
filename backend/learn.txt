Issue Description: Why dotenv.config() Doesn’t Work in Nested Modules

This problem occurs due to how ES module imports 
are hoisted in JavaScript, 
leading to an execution order issue that causes 
dotenv.config() to be called too late for the environment 
variables to be accessible in imported files.

solution:-
import 'dotenv/config'; // ✅ Automatically loads environment variables before anything else
